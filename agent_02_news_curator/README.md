# 🧠 Agent 02 – Smart News Curator

A modular, CLI-based AI agent that fetches, ranks, summarizes, and stores daily AI news — optimized for Raspberry Pi 5, using the Tavily API + OpenAI GPT.

---

## �� What It Does

- 🔍 Fetches the top 5 news stories about AI
- 🧠 Uses GPT to:
  - Assess each story’s significance
  - Summarize the article
  - Add 2–3 topic tags
- 💾 Saves structured summaries to `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- ⏰ Can run daily via Python scheduler or cron

---

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repo & Navigate

```bash
cd /mnt/ssd/projects/pi5-projects/ai-agent-lab
```

### 2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create `.env` in the project root

```env
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## 🧪 Running the Agent

### Manual Run:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Scheduled Run (Dev):
```bash
python scheduler.py
```

You can edit the schedule inside `scheduler.py` to test with `every(10).seconds` or run daily at 7AM.
