# 🤖 AI Agent Lab

A growing collection of autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents built on Raspberry Pi 5 using Python, OpenAI, Tavily, and other cutting-edge tools.

This lab serves as a learning space, teaching resource, and technical portfolio. Each agent is organized in its own subdirectory and solves a specific task or problem.

---

## 🧠 Why This Lab Exists

The goal of this project is to:
- Build modular, real-world AI agents
- Explore how agents can interact with tools and APIs
- Document the journey from script → autonomous AI
- Serve as a teaching reference for others interested in AI agents
